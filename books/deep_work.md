## Rules

* Commitment to deep work isn't enough. Habits and rituals are needed to support it.
* Espouse the _rythmic_ deep work philosophy -- aim for three 90 minute sessions per day.

**For the ritual:**

_Where will I work and for how long?_
* 90 minute sessions
* Breakout room on the 5th or 6th floor (at the office)
* Home office with door closed (at home)

_Deep work session preparation:_
* Snooze Slack notifications
* Set Skype to 'do not disturb'
* Turn phone on airplane mode
* Close all computer applications & browser windows that are unrelated to the deep work task

_Support during these sessions:_
* Full cup of coffee or hot water (even at home!)
* Instrumental music? Headphones?
* Track 3 pomodoros per session
* Walk/bathroom during the pomodoro breaks
